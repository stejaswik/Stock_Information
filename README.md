The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator of a stock which is used to visualize the stock price's momentum. MACD is calculated by calculating the difference between the exponential moving averages of the stock's closing price over a over a long time (typically 26 days) and short time (typically 12 days). The indicator value is the difference between the MACD value for a given date and the exponential moving average of MACD over the previous 9 days.

A positive Indicator value denotes the stock price is about to rise while the negative MACD denotes the stock is about to fall. The trend can be seen by observing the values of the stock as shown below.
