#### MACD Section

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator of a stock, used to visualize, using data, the stock price's momentum to rise/fall. MACD is calculated by calculating the difference between the exponential moving averages of the stock's closing price over a over time (typically 26 days) and short time (typically 12 days). The indicator value is the difference between the MACD value for a given dat ad the exponential moving average of MACD over the previous 9 days.

A positive Indicator value denotes the stock price is about to rise while the negative MACD denotes the stock is about to fall. The trend can be seen by observing the values of the stock as shown below.
